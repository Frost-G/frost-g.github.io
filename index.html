								<h2> Development Process</h2>
								<p> 
The parrot design was inspired by observing natural imagery and studying how a parrot typically sits on perches. The initial model was created using Blender 4.0 leveraging the expertise of a team member with advanced skills in this software. This allowed for the development of a 3D digital model, reflecting the intended structure and details of a parrot design. The original model was constructed as a single piece, as depicted in the reference images. To accommodate the requirements of 3D printing the design was divided into key components: the head, the main body with attached feet, a separate chest piece, and the perch. This segmentation ensures more efficient and practical printing while keeping the accuracy and visual components of the original design. The concentric cam was developed using Fusion 360 and also sent separately for printing. To move the chest piece the cam will be attached to the chest plate and seated inside the main body of the parrot. A small slot was added underneath the parrot to be able to rotate the cam to push the chest in an in-and-out motion as seen in the images.  A simple perch was designed and modeled for the parrot to fit on. To make sure the feet were able to fit the perch was given a slight oval shape so the crawl feet could fit around it. The separated pieces would then be sent for 3D printing using PLA. The parrot pieces are printed in red to copy a parrot’s true colours. Once the print is complete the design can then be sanded down for a smooth finish and then can move into the aesthetic covering stage. </p>
								<h2> Materials</h2>
								<p> This section will cover the different materials considered for this project</p>
								<h2> Plastics</h2>
								<p></p>
								<h2> PLA</h2>
								<p> Polylactic acid (PLA) is a common thermoplastic with biodegradable properties as it is made from renewable sources like sugarcane and corn starch. The eco-friendly alternative is widely used by engineers and manufacturers due to its versatility and availability. Compared to other thermoplastics PLA has a low melting point so can be printed without the need for an enclosed printer or heated bed. The material offers minimal warping and typically adheres well to build surfaces, reducing the chance of a print failure. PLA produces a low amount of toxic fumes and odor compared to other printing materials </p>
								<h2>ABS</h2>
								<p> 
Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) is a thermoplastic polymer known for its versatility durability and strength. This is one of the most popular materials in the printing industry and is commonly used in industrial applications. ABS is made from three monomers (acrylonitrile, butadiene, and styrene) and each component gives it its properties of strong, heat, and impact resistance. The impact resistance makes it perfect for manufacturing mechanical components and it can be repeatedly used without significant stress or wear. Some of the challenges of ABS include the higher glass transition which can cause warping during printing so a controlled temperature environment is often required to reduce the chances. ABS also emits toxic fumes with a specific odor so ventilation is crucial. </p>
								<h2> Nylon</h2>
								<p>Nylon is a synthetic polymer which is also known as polyamides. It offers durability, flexibility, and strength and is used in a range of industries including textiles, aerospace, and automotive. Nylon offers high resistance to abrasions and wear so is good for applications that require longevity. This material offers a degree of flexibility so is useful for parts that endure extra stress from bending. Nylon is also hygroscopic which means it can cause warping or reduced printing quality so often the filament requires pre-drying to prevent this. Compared to PLA nylon requires higher printing temperatures so specialized equipment may be required. </p>
								<h2> Resin Filement</h2>
								<p>Standard resin provides a balance between flexibility, strength, and detail. It is used for a range of applications that require fine detail whilst maintaining a smooth finish.
Tough resin is designed to mimic the properties of ABS, however, provides a greater resistance to impact and durability. 
Flexible resin is often used for applications that require a soft-touch, rubber-like, or high flexibility. It can also withstand being stretched without breaking or cracking.</p>
								<p>The use of resin is beneficial in cases that require intricate detail, smooth finishes, and durability. Some of the limitations of resin materials can be they generally require post-processing which often involves curing under UV light or washing in isopropyl alcohol which can add to the complexity and time of the build. Resins are often made of hazardous liquids and can create toxic fumes, so safety equipment is needed to handle or work with them. 
Compared to 3D printing, this method can be more expensive </p>
								<h3> Silicon Resin</h3>
								<p>Silicon resin is a synthetic polymer. Its properties include high thermal stability, water resistance, flexibility, and insulating characteristics. This resin is mainly composed of silicon-oxygen backbones, also known as siloxanes. The most common groups include methyl, phenyl, and vinyl. The different structures contribute to different material properties like hydrophobicity, thermal stability, and flexibility. Silicon resins are often used as insulators in electrical components, protective coatings, and electronic circuits. Additionally, they are considered safe for multiple applications as they are non-toxic and chemically stable. </p>
								<h3> Material selection</h3>
								<p> PLA was selected for this project as it holds similar properties to ABS, however, at a lower cost. PLA offers a lower possibility of warping which is better for this project as there is only one opportunity to print. It also offers reduced environmental impact and lower odor which a smoother finish. </p>

Cras viverra ligula sit amet ex mollis mattis lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
								<h2> Technologies</h2>
								<h3> 3D Printing</h3>
								<p> 3D printing is a process of creating three-dimensional objects from a digital file. Traditional manufacturing often involves cutting or removing materials from a larger block however, 3D printing builds objects layer by layer, and adding materials were necessary. A digital model is required for the printing. These are often designed in software like CAD, Blender, or Fusion 360. The printer will follow the instructions from the blueprint and slice the model into thin cross-sections, each slice representing a single layer of the object. Complex projects often require multiple prints which have to be later put together into one piece. Once a model has been printed a finishing process may be necessary to get the desired look like sanding, painting, or coating. The design of the printer allows for customised designs and reduced waste materials. For this project, 3D printing was chosen as the main technology due to its capabilities. The customised design meant features like body, wings, beaks, and eyes could be made to mimic a real parrot. The chest piece could also be designed to fit and move in a specific way to suit the articulation. 3D printing also works with the PLA material selected for this project making it lightweight and durable and since it is an indoor design the poor UV quality making PLA brittle won't affect this outcome. This method is also more cost-effective compared to other materials and technologies. Overall 3D printing suits the design of this project making for a versatile, flexible, and efficient model whilst staying within the project budget.</p>
								<h3> Motion Capture</h3>
								<p> Motion capture is a technology used to record the movement of objects or people. It involves tracking specific areas using cameras, sensors, or other devices and then transforming the motion into digital data which is used to replicate the movement. This has a range of advantages including the ability to capture complex or natural movements, is faster than traditional animation techniques, and reduced cost for large-scale production. Motion capture was not selected for this as it would not be possible to bring a real parrot in to be scanned as it is unethical and the parrot would move during the scanning process. Additionally, it could be done by scanning an already made 3D model however, this would increase the budget by purchasing a model when a similar outcome could have been reached at a lower cost from using software like Blender. </p>
								<h3> Haptic Pen</h3>
								<p> Haptic pens are an input device that provides feedback to the user. It is designed to simulate the feeling of touching or interacting with objects within a virtual environment and is often used for projects involving virtual reality or augmented reality. In simulated applications, this technology allows for precise manipulation of virtual objects so users can ‘feel’ when they’ve made contact with an object. For this project, haptic pens were not selected for the intricate level of details as the main body would be covered with aesthetic covering so other technologies were better suited in this case.  </p>
								<h3> Resin</h3>
								<p> Polyurethane resin is a type of polymer created from a chemical reaction between polyol and isocyanate which creates a range of materials with varying degrees of hardness, flexibility, and chemical resistance. The main characteristics include fast curing mainly around 20 minutes to set, versatility, and can withstand impact and chemicals. Polyurethane resin can be used to create molds for casting other materials like figurines, industrial parts some automotive components. Epoxy casting resin is a type of epoxy designed for casting applications. It comes in a two-part system, resin and a harder. When mixed a chemical reaction occurs which results in a clear, durable material. It is often used in applications that require clarity however, the whole process results in a longer curing time typically around 48 hours. Silicone rubber is a synthetic elastomer with characteristics including temperature resistance and flexibility. The main property of this is its ability to maintain elasticity across a wide temperature range whilst withstanding extreme temperatures. It is also used for model casting, but this extends into medical devices, kitchen bakeware, and some gaskets in automotive industries. Epoxy resin was considered for the face plate. A silicon mold would have been created from a 3D print of the face plate which the epoxy resin would have been set within however, due to time constraints this was unable to be achieved. </p>

								<h2> Articulation Development</h2>
								<p>For this project, the area of articulation will be the chest piece of the parrot. The aim is to move the chest in and out to mimic the look of breathing. Various cam designs could be considered for this project as each one would have a different effect. The three that will be considered are concentric, ovoid, and heart-shaped cam.</p>
								<h3> Ovoid cam</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/images for git/ovoid cam.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> Oval cams have changing radii which causes periods of acceleration and deceleration as it rotates. It features an elongated shape that has different distances from the center creating a unique motion. The design can be adjusted to suit a specific motion profile. </p>
								<h3> Concentric cam</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/images for git/Concentric cam.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> A simple but popular design where the cam moves along a circular path from a center point of rotation. The circle design generates a uniform and smooth motion with minimal difference in acceleration and speed. </p>
								<h3> Heart-shaped cam</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/images for git/heart shaped cam.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> This cam's unique shape generates a symmetric and smooth motion and is known for its predictable motion and back-and-forth oscillations. The cam allows for consistent acceleration and deceleration whilst it rotates. </p>
								<h3> Cam Selection</h3>
								<p>For this project, the oval cam is best suited to due to its elongated shape and varying radii along different points it would simulate the steady contractions of a breathing motion. </p>
